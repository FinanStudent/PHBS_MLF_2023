## Homeworks:
* ### __Set 1__ [Due by 09.11 Tues]
  * Register on Github.com and let TA and me know your ID. Give your __full name__ in your profile. Accept invitation to the [PHBS organization](https://github.com/orgs/PHBS/people) from TA. Install [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) (available on [CMS](http://cms.phbs.pku.edu.cn/claroline/course/index.php?cid=FN570)).
  * Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) Python distribution (__3.X version__, 2.X version). Anaconda distribution is core Python + useful scientific computation libraries (e.g., numpy, scipy, pandas) + package management system (pip or conda)
  * Send the screenshot of both softwares installed to TA. (Example: [Github Desktop](files/Choi_Jaehyuk_Github.png), [Anaconda Spyder](files/Choi_Jaehyuk_Python.png))

## Course overview

With the advent of computation power and big data, machine learning recently became one of the most spotlighted research field in industry and academia. This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning in theoretical and practical perspectives. Through this course, students will learn the intuition and implementation behind the popular machine learning methods and gain hands-on experience of using ML software packages such as SK-learn and Tensorflow. This course will also explore the possibility of applying ML to finance and business. Each student is required to complete a final course project. 

## Prerequisites

Undergraduate-level knowledge in probability/statistics and previous experience in programming language (python) is highly recommended.
